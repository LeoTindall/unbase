#### From the spatial-overlay-as-a-service department

It's late on a Friday night. You're into your third hour of Guild Wars 2 and your european buddy hits you up – They want you to join their EU server. You then proceed to spend the next hour cursing the lag, and getting a lot of [rubberbanding](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rubberbanding){:target="define"} before you decide to call it a night.

Why does this happen? Why do you get strange behavior from the EU server when you're in Los Angeles?

#### Let's face facts:
As it turns out, the universe we occupy is a little lacking in the sci-fi-physics department. There's no faster-than-light travel; not for spaceships, and not even for data. Worse yet, It's not simply a matter of the galactic postal service being slow – _Existence itself_ (read "information") has a maximum speed.


#### Space Exists

It doesn't matter if we're talking about interstellar distances, micrometers on silicon, or anywhere in between; Information can only propagate through space so fast. Information is therefore *local*, both in terms of it's origin, and it's effects. Don't hold your breath, physicists are not optimistic about FTL transportation of information through entanglement either.

#### Simultineity doesn't

There's no such thing as simultaneity, at least not in the way most people think about it. Whether we're talking about wall clocks, atomic clocks, or laser light pulses, simultaneity can only ever be a *comparative* property from the point of view of a single observer. There is no gods-eye view, no plane of simultaneity surrounding the earth.

#### When in Rome

The physical reality around us doesn't have centralized arbiters of truth, It's decentralized.
When I set down my glass on the table, it doesn't have to coordinate with a datacenter in Ashburn to avoid spontaneously jumping to the opposite side of the table. It has local, *causal*, **coordination free** consistency. So too, should our systems. This consistency model is totally consistent with our perspective as humans, because it's the same consistency model we were born into.
