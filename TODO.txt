Steps Believed necessary for the passage of the first self-consistency test case:

[X] Arc-ify SlabRef ( necessary because of all the memorefs that will be pointing to it for peering management )
[X] Enable MemoRef management by the Slab
  [X] For the memo itself
  [X] For memo -> parent memos
[X] Finish renaming Record -> Subject
[X] Finish basic subject subscription plumbing
[ ] Implement determinizer
[ ] Dummy memo durability scoring ( hardcode zero )
[ ] Dummy subject subscription on remote slab
[ ] memo peering
[ ] Basic state projection logic
[ ] Slab arc vs SlabRef arc - eliminate unnecessary double-Arc and switch all Slab handles to SlabRef handles?
[ ] memo durability scoring
[ ] durability scoring buckets (start with fixed number of buckets, later make it variable)
[ ] Memo -> relation memos
[ ] Basic indexing
[ ] Update slab.subject_subscriptions to use memo-based projection in lieu of hashmap
    (local subscriptions should be no different from nonlocal subscriptions)
[ ] Update SlabRef to accept different kinds of channels, not just simulator channels
[ ] Peering Memos
  [ ] Emit Goodbye memos for slabs that are shutting down
  [ ] Local Peering Memos?

Selectable Write Mutex:
When we want to force a specific order of events for testing purposes

                        Lock <- SlabRef::send_memo
                                Channel write
deliver_all_messages -> Lock
        Channel Read in full
