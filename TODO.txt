Steps Believed necessary for the passage of the first self-consistency test case:

[X] Arc-ify SlabRef ( necessary because of all the memorefs that will be pointing to it for peering management )
[ ] Enable MemoRef management by the Slab
  [ ] For the memo itself
  [ ] For memo -> parent memos
  [ ] For memo -> relation memos
[ ] Finish renaming Record -> Subject
[ ] Finish Subject subscription plumbing
[ ] Basic state projection logic



SLAB
  MemoRef A (peers) -> Memo A
                       |
                    MemoRef B  -> Memo B
