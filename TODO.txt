Steps Believed necessary for the passage of the first self-consistency test case:

[X] Arc-ify SlabRef ( necessary because of all the memorefs that will be pointing to it for peering management )
[X] Enable MemoRef management by the Slab
  [X] For the memo itself
  [X] For memo -> parent memos
[X] Finish renaming Record -> Subject
[X] Finish basic subject subscription plumbing
[X] Implement rudimentary simulator
[X] stop endless memo emission / bouncing
[~] Subject indexes
    [X] Dummy subject head index
    [X] All received memos get mindlessly jammed into subject head index
    [X] subject head index is actually pruned to leave only the head memos
    [NEXT] subject head index is itself built from memos
    [ ] bootstrap subject index which requires the subject index
    [ ] local subscriptions should be no different from nonlocal subscriptions
[X] memo body
[X] memo peering
[NEXT] Memo -> relation memos
[X] memo retrieval ( slab.localize_memo )
   [X] Return found Memo
   [X] Memo not found response (Participating/NonParticipating)
[ ] basic memo durability scoring
[~] Basic state projection logic
    [X] Extremely basic Causal LWW hash keys
    [ ] Extremely basic LWW relationship-supersession
[~] Peering Memos
  [X] inter-slab peering memos
  [ ] Consolidate multiple peering changes into a single peering memo
  [ ] Emit Goodbye memos for slabs that are shutting down
  [ ] Local Peering Memos?
  [ ] Determine if Subject-Peering is necessary for indexes (peering which is silently subsumed by newer memos)
[ ] Hash-based Memo ID generation
  [ ] Lazy hash generation
      Memos which are never transmitted to another slab should never have MemoIds assigned.
      Hard linkage precludes the need for MemoId generation. Only necessary when transmitting.
  [ ] Commutatively merge-able Subjects:
      hash of: type (edit/keyframe?), values, tier/context, *fully materialized references*
      How do we prefer a keyframe memo vs the head of a chain of edit memos?
      They'll have identical checksums.

      Think about: is this still a Merkel tree?
      (context root -> child -> child -> leaf: yes)

      Barring a cryptographically secure commutative
      hash, the necessary commutative property is defeated by inclusion of the precursors,
      which will vary dramatically.
  [ ] Standard Subjects: hash of values, references, parent
[ ] Very basic testing
  [ ] basic asymmetric communication scenarios ( memo conveyed from SlabA->SlabB but not C, etc )
  [ ] basic data loss scenarios
[ ] Cleanup
  [ ] Memo / MemoRef serialization across slabs ( Memorefs may get leaked at present )
  [ ] Differentiable data types
  [ ] durability scoring buckets (start with fixed number of buckets, later make it variable)
  [ ] Remove unnecessary memo relations arguments
  [ ] Update SlabRef to accept different kinds of channels, not just simulator channels
  [ ] Move XYZPoint out of network::Sender into slab
  [ ] Determine how to make second order effects deterministic
  [ ] Revise test suite with more robust spatial scenarios
  [?] Slab arc vs SlabRef arc - eliminate unnecessary double-Arc and switch all Slab handles to SlabRef handles?
